Tec_see
=============
In this repo, I have created an API for Tec-see as an assessment
The system has two types of users (user, admin), each one has its own functions, like the following

* Admin(Supervisor)
    * Create/Update/Remove/Get a project
    * Create/Update/Remove/Get a task
    * Assign an employee for a task
    * Remove an employee from a task

* User(Employee)
    * Submit a task
    * View his (submitted/pending/all) tasks
    * View his projects
    * Add a new stadium.
    * View match details
    * View vacant/reserved seats for each match.
